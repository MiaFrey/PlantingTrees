# Would planting trees in desert areas reduce the global temperature?

## Problem

Sea level rises, animals go extinct, the frequency of natural disasters increases... Those are only a few examples of the problems we face due to an accumulation of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change is a major problem of our times. The global average temperature (GAT) keeps rising and could lead to reaching irreversible tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheets (Schmale, 2021). The Paris Agreement aims to keep GAT below 1.5 degrees but how can we reach this goal?

## Solution

To mitigate climate change one solution is to plant a trillion trees in the Sahara Desert. This is similar to the number of Goymer, who estimated that we would need 1.2 trillion trees to absorb the excess CO2 (Goymer, 2018). To put this into perspective, currently, there are around 3 trillion trees on earth, this is half the amount that existed before human civilization (Crowther et al. 2015).

In this report, we estimate the impact of this mitigation strategy with the help of data and machine learning techniques. This data-driven approach aims to find a way to counteract climate change. We analyse the effect of planting trees on the GAT through three channels. The first one is task A, where we analyse how trees sequestrate CO2 which would then lead to less CO2 in the atmosphere and eventually decrease the temperature. The second channel is the albedo change looked at  in task B. The desert changes from a light brown to dark green, this affects the reflective capabilities of the earth and thus temperature. Further, in task C we will analyse the impact on the water cycle which again will  change temperature. Finally, we put these three channels together to analyze the overall impact of planting trees on GAT and give a policy recommendation. We would like to note that planting trees is not sufficient, we also need to reduce our emissions.

## Task A: Model and predict the GAT based on updated CO2 emissions if we plant 1 trillion trees.

In this part, we will model and predict the GAT. The aim is to find the impact of panting 1 trillion trees on CO2 sequestration. We examine different scenarios to determine if planting a trillion trees is a viable solution to tackle climate change. We would like to note that we are aware of the controversy of this topic but we aim to understand the situation and predict GAT based on these different scenarios.

The three main scenarios are:
1. Business as usual, meaning a continuous increase of emissions
2. Realistic decrease of emissions to 69%
3. Net-zero by 2050
4. Best rate, decrease emissions to 10%

For each of these scenarios, we model what would happen if:
a. We do not plant any trees and assume that the number of trees worldwide remains constant.
b. We plant a trillion trees and assume that they sequestrate 42 GtC.
c. We plant a trillion trees and assume that they sequestrate 107 GtC.

In the following grid, each scenario and its predicted plots are depicted. The columns represent no trees, trees that sequestrate 42GtC and 107GtC. The rows represent the scenarios, namely business as usual, decrease to 69%, zero-carbon and decrease to 10%.

## Policy Recommendation

Regarding policy recommendations, we have to be careful. First let's be clear: planting a million trees won't solve the climate crisis. The priority has to be to change our habits in consuming and using energy. We need to stop the growth that has been going on for many decades and start considering other narratives. However, we will need to use technology to help us doing so combined with a cultural change on how we consume and treat nature. One technical aspect on how we can reduce our CO2 emissions are carbon dioxide removal techniques, which could definitely help us to mitigate climate change. Similarly, planting trees is a good thing. It can only be positive as it helps cleaning the air and reduces the global average temperatures. But in this study, we found that even with a trillion trees planted, the sufficiency to reach the Paris Agreement strongly depends on the emission scenario in question.

## Further Research

The amount of carbon sequestrated by planting trees is still uncertain because researchers find extremely different results. This is only one example in which machine learning can help to get more exact estimations of the impact of reforestation.

It would also be helpful to analyze where trees can be grown efficiently and try to understand better the link between albedo change and the GAT. As already mentioned in Task B, a lot of assumptions flow into our modelisation. These assumptions should be verified in future studies. Generally, the GAT and the climate system are influenced by many factors and feedback loops. It is an extremely challenging task to model them all as near to reality as possible but at the same time not overcomplicate it. Hence, climate scientists,engineers,  data scientists, etc. all need to work together to combat climate change.
